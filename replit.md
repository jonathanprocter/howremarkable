## Overview

The reMarkable Pro Digital Planner is a React-based single-page application designed specifically for the reMarkable Pro tablet. It provides a comprehensive digital planning experience with weekly and daily calendar views, Google Calendar integration, and PDF export capabilities. The application is built with modern web technologies and optimized for the reMarkable Pro's e-ink display.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js server with REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Package Manager**: npm with workspace configuration

## Key Components
